      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following attempts to distill the shared context we have developed over the last year and a half. The guiding question motivating this work is, &amp;ldquo;what is it about the confluence of digital technology and global economic circuits that needs to change?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>What we are creating We build and consult on the use of software tools which provision for the necessities of life whilst making possible complex cross-cultural intersections and humane and vibrant modes of relating, exchanging, and caring for self, other, and community.
Tools for economic autonomy ValueFlows Meeting the challenges of our times requires not just a new economic system, but a new vocabulary to enable it. ValueFlows reimagines accounting as the tracking and coordination of production, distribution, and exchange of all kinds of resources; from goods and services and energy, to knowledge, to currencies, to &amp;ldquo;current-sees&amp;quot;; in motion in fractal P2P economic networks.</description>

      <description>Lynn Foster and Bob Haugen live on the web at mikorizal.org, and live for real in rural Wisconsin US, where we can live cheap and do what retired people everywhere should be able to do – what we want!
What we want is to use the knowledge we have (like 4+ decades each of economic software development experience) to help groups bravely organizing fair and sustainable economic experiments on the ground.</description>

      <guid>https://economikit.org/about-us/pospi/</guid>
      <description>pospi is an idealist by fate; distributed systems engineer by trade; accidental economist and sociologist; and recovering technologist, futurist and entrepreneur. After attempting to make social media meaningful at an early age, co-launching a startup to &amp;ldquo;fix charity&amp;rdquo; and designing economic systems to &amp;ldquo;solve climate change&amp;rdquo; with blockchain; they have finally arrived at the only conclusions possible. That the advances afforded by technological systems have mostly only ever caused vast harms to many, that entrepreneurial framings tied into market-based solutionism and the logics of individualism ultimately corrupt efforts toward change, and that the implied power dynamics of aid relations and vaunted intellectual status of individuals in STEM fields often acts against the interests of those we aim to help.</description>
