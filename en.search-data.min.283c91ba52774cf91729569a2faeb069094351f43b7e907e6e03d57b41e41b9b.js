Governance conversation: who should have admin access?   Need to author good project descriptions for both Holo-REA and ValueFlows-UI Need to create good branding imagery for both Holo-REA and ValueFlows-UI  (should probably make a batch for this and throw a bounty in there to coax a designer into doing it?) (Anyone know a good graphic designer?)   Create some task batches for stuff we need to do internally within the group (incl. the above)  (for later)\n Find someone to make nice videos, or record project demo videos  Build some UIs for Holo-REA that would actually make this impressive; I suggest a work logging and inventory management UI which update in real time response to each other Batch for wider community: graphql subscriptions API for Holochain apps    Random things to think about  How best to handle the information architecture for a collaborative brand like this? I envisage… separate websites / gitbooks for each project’s own documentation, with an overarching website which leads people into each subproject. “Overarching” website probably wants to be largely tailored for business analyst types; detailing use of the different toolkit components by way of real-world examples. Guiding governance that enables us to build a coherent strategy.  Economic Design for the Collective: Initial ramble by Sid, feel free to add comments/ask for clarifications:\nGuardrails:\n Co-op like structure for funding instruments. I.e. Credits/Zero coupon bonds/IOUs preferred over shares. Eventually, the currency would operate as a value-stable resource i.e. drawing on designs of sufficiency. However, the initial phase may rely on scarcity dynamics (Similar to the HOT to HF transition)  Short/Medium term Intentions:\n To design some form of material currency that enables people who wish to support this project to contribute, and benefit in some way in monetary terms. It could be along the lines of an economic system we created for SC with David Atkinson way back.  Governance structure, and internal reputation system that guides the flow of material capital Open questions: external capital? Tradable currency?  Longer term intentions:\n A currency system that enables frictionless capital deployment on a need-basis One way to go about it is to create a breathable supply, that allows fresh issuances on the basis of reputation-at-stake.  Thoughts on Governance\nThoughts on Reputation System\nThoughts on Monetary System:\n Suite of Micro-services that invoice applications on the basis of computation capacity drawn down? What is the feasibility of this? Open-source system driven purely by reputation currency + grants from enthusiastic funders?  Marketing/Outreach/Comms/Design Sessions/Hackathons etc.\nSid: I think there’s definitely a need for an over-arching story to be told here. My sense is it could be deeply moving and attractive for all stakeholders. Giving some thought to this over the weekend.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/book/administrivia/','title':"Administrivia",'content':"Administrivia   Software tools \u0026amp; points of authority   Group members, interests and roles   Noteworthy links   Similar groups \u0026amp; related efforts   "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/book/administrivia/group-members-interests-and-roles/','title':"Group Members Interests and Roles",'content':"Group members, interests and roles  Marketing: Tom, Sid Naming / branding: pospi, Jean, Sid Purpose \u0026amp; vision statement: Jean, pospi, Sid Ethical guidelines: Jean, pospi Fund management: Noah, Tom Protocol design: pospi, Bob Economics design: Bob Holochain Blog: Amanda DHT  "});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/book/administrivia/noteworthy-links/','title':"Noteworthy Links",'content':"Noteworthy links Holo-REA   Holo-REA project on CoMakery (currently unlisted, needs branding)  Holo-REA documentation wiki   Sacred Capital   Sacred Capital technical documentation   InvestorEngine   Draft Management Plan   InvestorEngine CoMakery page   ValueFlows UI   ValueFlows UI project on CoMakery (currently unlisted, needs branding)  Thought: how much do we want to bite off here in terms of trying to standardise schemas? I think there is room for a common article / comment taxonomy, potentially even a common reputation taxonomy. If we define these as GraphQL schemas and think of that as a base platform then it becomes very easy to standardise and mix in functionality that is not part of ValueFlows. Those schemas can form part of a data commons. What else, beyond this kind of stuff, does Commons Engine mean by their “data commons”? That being the case, would better branding for “ValueFlows UI project” potentially be something broader, like (keeping to the current mission theme) “P2P economy kit”? We have many contributors from quite diverse industry backgrounds lined up already.

We aim to embody and spread the adoption of feminine technologies, organising principles, social norms and regenerative design patterns. Real change comes organically, from the bottom upwards. It cannot be dictated, controlled or managed; it must emerge organically and fluidly. The outcomes created by an organisation are a direct consequence of its culture. Nurturing and holding space for culture are the most important and fundamental things a group can do to ensure their long-term success. Change must be embodied, lived and practised in order to be realised. The more beautiful world our hearts know is possible must be created first by living inside it. Everything begins in the way we are; the things we do come secondary. There is no \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo; that can save us from planetary collapse. No solutions are final. Nothing we create has universal applicability. All we can do is to enact incremental improvements, assess and improve. The success of the process hinges on us staying in conversation with those who use our tools. Continual effort and energy must be placed into maintaining counter-cultures to our modern day capitalist Imperialist Patriarchy. External society and norms exert pressure; resistance must be practised in our everyday ways of being. \u0026ldquo;On the day after the revolution, the revolutionaries will be the new incumbents\u0026rdquo;.
