We\u0026rsquo;ll send you an invite to a periodical collective video call. Whoever is on the call will greet you and ask you to tell a story about how you came to be here. (We have a practise of telling lots of stories.) After the call, we\u0026rsquo;ll chat a bit about how the interaction felt and pass on your details to the rest of the collective. We usually provide a 1-week voting period for anybody to raise any blockers before committing and approving your Loomio invite. If approved, you\u0026rsquo;ll become just as much a part of the collective as the rest of us and the goal will be to deepen our relationship over time.
